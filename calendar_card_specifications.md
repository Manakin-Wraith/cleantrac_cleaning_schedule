# Calendar Card Information Specifications

This document specifies the essential information to display on calendar event cards for both cleaning and recipe calendars, optimized for desktop viewing.

## Information Priority Framework

Information on calendar cards is organized according to these priority levels:

1. **Primary (Always Visible)**: Essential information that must always be visible in any view
2. **Secondary (View-Dependent)**: Important information shown based on available space and view type
3. **Tertiary (On-Demand)**: Additional details shown on hover, selection, or in expanded views
4. **Hidden (Modal Only)**: Detailed information only accessible via modal/detail view

## Progressive Disclosure Implementation

### Default State

- Use color to convey status
- Maintain consistent height based on view

### Hover State
- Expand to show all secondary information
- Add subtle elevation effect
- Show tooltip with tertiary information

### Selected State
- Highlight with distinct border
- Show action buttons if applicable
- Maintain expanded state until deselected

## Typography and Formatting Guidelines

### Recipe Name / Task Name
- Font: System primary font, semi-bold
- Size: 14px (month), 16px (week/day/timeline)
- Color: High contrast against background
- Truncation: Ellipsis after 1 line (month/week), 2 lines (day/timeline)

### Time Display
- Format by view:
  - Month: Hidden or icon only
  - Week: "10:00-11:30" (compact)
  - Day: "10:00 AM - 11:30 AM" (full)
  - Timeline: "10:00-11:30" (compact)

### Staff Name
- Format: First name + last initial (e.g., "John S.")
- Only show when relevant to view context

### Batch Size / Priority
- Format: Value + unit (e.g., "50 units")
- Use icon prefix for visual scanning

## Status Visualization

| Status | Border Color | Background | Icon |
|--------|--------------|------------|------|

## Interaction Patterns

### Click Behavior
- Single click: Select card and show full details in sidebar/panel
- Double click: Open edit modal
- Right click: Context menu with quick actions

### Drag Behavior
- Drag handle: Subtle indicator on hover
- Visual feedback: Shadow and transparency during drag
- Drop indicators: Highlight valid drop zones

## Accessibility Considerations

- Color is never the sole indicator of status (always paired with shape/icon)
- Sufficient contrast ratios for all text elements
- Screen reader friendly alternative text
- Keyboard navigable with clear focus indicators

## Implementation Notes

1. Use CSS variables for consistent color application
2. Implement view-specific card components that share a common base
3. Use CSS Grid for layout to maximize space efficiency
4. Consider virtual scrolling for performance with many events
5. Implement responsive breakpoints for different desktop sizes
