# CleanTrack Application - Technology Stack

This document outlines the chosen technology stack for the CleanTrack application.

## 1. Frontend

- **Language/Framework:** JavaScript with **React**
  - *Reasoning:* Modern, component-based architecture ideal for interactive UIs. Strong community and ecosystem.
- **UI Library:** **Material-UI (MUI)**
  - *Reasoning:* Provides a comprehensive set of pre-built, production-ready components based on Material Design, accelerating UI development and ensuring a consistent look and feel.

## 2. Backend

- **Language/Framework:** Python with **Django**
  - *Reasoning:* Robust, high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. "Batteries-included" approach (ORM, admin panel) is beneficial for features like user and department management.

## 3. Database

- **Production Database:** **PostgreSQL**
  - *Reasoning:* Powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. Handles concurrent users and data scalability well, making it suitable for live deployment with real users and future growth.
- **Development Database (Initial):** **SQLite**
  - *Reasoning:* Lightweight, file-based database, excellent for rapid initial development and local testing due to its simplicity and zero-configuration setup. Django's ORM allows for a relatively smooth transition to PostgreSQL for staging/production.

## 4. Version Control

- **System:** **Git**
  - *Reasoning:* Distributed version control system, standard for modern software development, enabling efficient collaboration and code history management.

## Development & Deployment Considerations

- **Python Virtual Environment:** To manage project dependencies for Django.
- **Node.js/npm/yarn:** For managing frontend (React) dependencies.
- **API Design:** RESTful APIs will be designed and implemented using Django REST framework (DRF) is highly recommended for building robust APIs with Django.
- **Deployment:** The application will be designed for live deployment, with considerations for database migrations, static file serving, and a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn + Nginx).
