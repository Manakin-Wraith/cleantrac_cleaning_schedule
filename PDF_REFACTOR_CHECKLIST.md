# PDF Refactoring Checklist: Excel to PDF Document Generation

## Phase 1: Remove Excel Legacy Code & Setup

### Backend (`core/document_template_views.py`)
- [x] **Identify `openpyxl` Usage:** Locate all sections of code in `generate_document_file` and related functions that use `openpyxl` for Excel generation.
- [x] **Comment Out/Remove Excel Logic:** Safely remove or comment out `openpyxl`-specific code (workbook creation, sheet manipulation, cell writing, styling).
- [x] **Modify API Response for PDF:** (Handled in `GeneratedDocumentViewSet.create` and `generate_document_file`)
    - [x] Change `HttpResponse` content type from `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` to `application/pdf`.
    - [x] Update `Content-Disposition` header to suggest a `.pdf` filename.
- [x] **Implement PDF Generation:** `generate_document_file` now generates PDF content using ReportLab with proper styling and layout.

### Frontend
- [x] **`GeneratedDocumentList.jsx`:** (Updated for PDF support)
    - [x] Updated file icons to represent PDF files
    - [x] Download functionality updated to handle `.pdf` extensions
    - [x] Added visual feedback for file type
- [x] **`DocumentTemplateList.jsx`:** (Enhanced UI/UX)
    - [x] Replaced browser alert with Material-UI Dialog for delete confirmation
    - [x] Added Snackbar notifications for user feedback
    - [x] Improved error handling and user feedback
- [x] **`DocumentGenerationForm.jsx` / `DocumentPreview.jsx`:** (Reviewed and updated)
    - [x] Removed Excel-specific logic
    - [x] Updated preview to work with PDF output
    - [x] Improved form validation and error handling
- [x] **General UI Review:**
    - [x] Updated all references from "Excel" to "PDF" or "Document"
    - [x] Ensured consistent styling and user experience

### Dependencies
- [x] **Select PDF Library:** Chose ReportLab for PDF generation
- [x] **Add to `requirements.txt`:** Added `reportlab>=4.0.0` to requirements.txt
- [x] **Install Dependency:** Verified installation in development environment
- [x] **Frontend Dependencies:**
    - [x] Confirmed Material-UI components are properly imported
    - [x] Added Snackbar for user notifications
    - [x] Ensured all UI components are properly styled and responsive

## Phase 2: Implement PDF Generation

### Backend (`core/document_template_views.py`)
- [x] **Integrated ReportLab PDF Library**
  - [x] Imported and configured ReportLab in `generate_document_file`
  - [x] Set up document templates with proper page size and margins
  - [x] Implemented consistent styling for headers, footers, and content

- [x] **PDF Structure and Layout**
  - [x] Standardized document structure with title and metadata sections
  - [x] Implemented card-style layout for data presentation
  - [x] Added professional headers with company branding
  - [x] Included page numbers and document information in footer

- [x] **Data Presentation**
  - [x] Created responsive tables for structured data
  - [x] Implemented conditional formatting for status indicators
  - [x] Added proper spacing and section breaks
  - [x] Included visual hierarchy with typography and colors

- [x] **Template Type Support**
  - [x] Temperature logs with range indicators
  - [x] Verification records with status tracking
  - [x] Cleaning schedules with task completion status
  - [x] Custom styling for each template type

- [x] **User Experience**
  - [x] Added manager sign-off section with signature line
  - [x] Included document generation timestamp
  - [x] Improved error messages and validation
  - [x] Optimized PDF file size for quick downloads

### Testing (Phase 2 & 3)
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for PDF generation logic (e.g., check for PDF validity, key text presence). (Consider feasibility and scope)
- [ ] **Manual Testing (User to perform):**
    - [ ] Test document generation for each template type (`temperature`, `verification`, `cleaning`) with various parameters.
    - [ ] Verify data accuracy, headers, footers, conditional formatting, and overall layout in generated PDFs.
    - [ ] Check formatting, layout, and styling.
    - [ ] Test with various data scenarios (empty data, large data sets).
    - [ ] Test on different browsers/PDF viewers if compatibility is a concern.

### Documentation
- [ ] **Update User Documentation:** Reflect the change from Excel to PDF generation.
- [ ] **Update Developer Documentation:** Document the new PDF generation process and any decisions made about template interpretation.

## Phase 3: Cleanup and Review
- [ ] **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review of all changes.
- [ ] **Remove Dead Code:** Ensure all old Excel-related code (if commented out) is fully removed.
- [ ] **Optimize:** Look for any performance optimization opportunities in PDF generation.
