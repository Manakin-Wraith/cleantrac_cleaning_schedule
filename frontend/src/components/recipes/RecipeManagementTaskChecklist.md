## Notes
- All components use Material UI with consistent styling and transitions
- Department-based theming is applied via color props to visually align UI elements with the user's department
- Permissions are enforced both on the backend and frontend, with UI elements conditionally rendered based on user role
- Backend API endpoints are used for fetching and submitting data, filtered by department for security
