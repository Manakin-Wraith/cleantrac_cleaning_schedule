"""Health-check command to verify connectivity to the external traceability
(Postgres) database and that the expected number of rows are present in
`received_products`.  Intended for use in CI/CD pipelines and manual
troubleshooting.

Usage::

    python manage.py check_traceability_db [--expected 700]

The command exits with status-code 1 if the query fails or if the row count is
below the expected threshold.
