# Sidebar UI/UX Enhancements Checklist

This checklist tracks the tasks for modernizing and improving the sidebar navigation in the CleanTrac application.

## I. Core Sidebar Structure & Theming
-   [ ] **Integrate Dark Mode Compatibility (Part of broader Dark Mode effort)**
    -   [ ] Ensure sidebar elements adapt correctly to dark mode theme.
    -   [ ] Verify text and icon contrast in dark mode.

## II. Nested Navigation with Grouping
-   [x] **Design Navigation Hierarchy**
    -   [x] Identify logical groupings for existing and planned navigation links (e.g., "Dashboard", "Management", "Tasks", "Thermometers", "Settings").
    -   [x] Define parent and child relationships for menu items.
-   [x] **Implement Collapsible Sections (Material UI)**
    -   [x] Use Material UI `List`, `ListItem`, `ListItemIcon`, `ListItemText`, and `Collapse` components.
    -   [x] Add expand/collapse icons (e.g., `ExpandMoreIcon`, `ChevronRightIcon` or `ArrowDropDownIcon`/`ArrowRightIcon`).
    -   [x] Manage open/closed state for each collapsible group (e.g., local component state in `Sidebar.jsx`).
-   [x] **Styling and Visuals**
    -   [x] Ensure clear visual distinction between parent items and child items (e.g., indentation for child items).
    -   [x] Style parent items to indicate they are clickable to expand/collapse.
    -   [x] Ensure icons and text align correctly in both expanded and collapsed states.
-   [x] **Functionality**
    -   [x] Clicking a parent item toggles the visibility of its children.
    -   [x] Clicking a child item navigates to the respective page.
    -   [x] Ensure navigation works correctly when the sidebar is collapsed (icons only) and expanded.

## III. Contextual Sidebar
-   [x] **Active Route Highlighting**
    -   [x] Clearly highlight the currently active navigation link.
    -   [x] If the active link is a child item, ensure its parent group is also visually indicated as active or expanded.
    -   [x] Use `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` to determine the active path.
-   [ ] **(Future) Section-Specific Sub-Navigation (Advanced)**
    -   [ ] Design how the sidebar might change to show more specific sub-options when a user is deep within a particular application section (e.g., detailed settings sub-menu).
    -   [ ] Plan data structure for defining contextual navigation items.

## IV. Mobile Experience Considerations
-   [ ] **Review Current Mobile Sidebar Behavior**
    -   [ ] Assess how nested navigation impacts the mobile sidebar experience.
-   [ ] **(Future) Bottom Navigation Exploration**
    -   [ ] Identify 3-5 primary navigation items suitable for a bottom navigation bar on mobile.
    -   [ ] Research Material UI `BottomNavigation` component for potential future implementation.
    -   *Note: Full bottom navigation implementation is a separate, larger task.*

## V. Refinements & Testing
-   [x] **Code Review and Refactoring**
    -   [x] Ensure `Sidebar.jsx` remains maintainable.
    -   [x] Optimize state management for collapsible sections.
-   [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**
    -   [ ] Test sidebar functionality and appearance on major browsers.
-   [ ] **Responsiveness Testing**
    -   [ ] Verify behavior across different screen sizes, including how nested items are handled when the sidebar is collapsed to icon-only view.
-   [ ] **Accessibility (a11y) Check**
    -   [ ] Ensure keyboard navigability for all sidebar items (expanding/collapsing groups, navigating to links).
    -   [ ] Check ARIA attributes for interactive elements.
